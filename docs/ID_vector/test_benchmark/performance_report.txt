ID_VECTOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS REPORT
================================================================================

OVERALL PERFORMANCE SUMMARY:
  Average speedup vs unordered_set: 16.2x
  Average speedup vs std::vector:   45.7x
  Average memory ratio vs unordered_set: 0.036 (3.6%)
  Average memory ratio vs std::vector:   0.287 (28.7%)

BEST PERFORMANCE SCENARIOS:
  Best speedup vs unordered_set: Small Sparse Dataset (BPV=1) (35.5x)
  Best speedup vs std::vector:   Very Large Sparse (BPV=1) (76.3x)
  Best memory efficiency vs unordered_set: Dense Dataset (BPV=1) (0.5%)
  Best memory efficiency vs std::vector:   Dense Dataset (BPV=1) (7.2%)

KEY INSIGHTS:
  • ID_vector consistently outperforms both alternatives in speed
  • Memory efficiency is exceptional vs unordered_set (avg 96.4% savings)
  • Also memory efficient vs std::vector (avg 71.3% savings)
  • Fastest execution: Dense Lookup (BPV=1) (832 ns)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Use ID_vector when memory is limited and IDs have known upper bounds
  • Particularly effective for sparse datasets with large ID ranges
  • BPV=1 for unique sets, BPV=2+ for multisets with count limits
