# Using `data_collector` output with `hog_transform`

This folder contains the toolkit to:

1. Capture a dataset on the ESP32 (images + labels).
2. Transfer the dataset and its camera configuration file to the PC (`result/` folder).
3. Use that dataset as input to the HOG feature extraction tool in `tools/hog_transform/`.

The key step after collecting and transferring a dataset is to configure the `hog_config.json` file so that `hog_transform` knows which dataset and camera settings to use.

## Runtime capture server overview

`tools/data_collector/dataset_capture_server.ino` runs directly on the ESP32-CAM and serves a Wi-Fi dashboard, letting you:

- Set the dataset name that becomes the root folder (`tools/data_collector/result/<dataset_name>/`).
- Supply the class label you plan to capture before pressing **Start Capture**.
- Stream frames, stop, and finish the session before the built-in save flow moves images under `<dataset_name>/<class_name>/`.
- Export a camera configuration JSON named `<dataset_name>_camera_config.json` so downstream tooling knows the exact lens settings.

The dashboard now enforces this ordering: the dataset name and class label must both be configured before a capture session can begin, and class entry happens at the beginning of a session instead of after it finishes. The server sanitizes both values (removing reserved names such as `_sessions`/`_session`) and reuses them in the transfer pipeline and camera config export.

## 1. What you get from `data_collector`

After you run the capture and transfer pipeline, you will have:

- A dataset folder under `tools/data_collector/result/`, e.g.:
  - `tools/data_collector/result/gesture/`
- A camera configuration JSON file for this dataset, e.g.:
  - `tools/data_collector/result/gesture/gesture_camera_config.json`

The camera config file contains fields describing:

- Sensor resolution (width, height)
- Pixel format / color mode
- Cropping / ROI info (if used)
- Any ESP32-specific camera parameters needed for HOG

You will reuse **exactly** these ESP32 camera settings in the next step.

### With file locations

```text
[1] Capture on ESP32
    - Sketch: tools/data_collector/dataset_capture_server.ino

[2] Transfer to PC
    - ESP32 side: tools/data_collector/data_transfer/esp32_side/dataset_transfer_sender.ino
    - PC side:    tools/data_collector/data_transfer/pc_side/fetch_dataset_from_esp32.py

[3] Result on PC
  - Dataset:    tools/data_collector/result/<dataset_name>/<dataset_name>.csv (or equivalent dataset files) at the root of the dataset folder.
  - Camera cfg: tools/data_collector/result/<dataset_name>/<dataset_name>_camera_config.json

[4] HOG transform
    - Config:     tools/hog_transform/hog_config.json
    - Tool code:  tools/hog_transform/
```

---

## 3. Configure `hog_config.json` for a new dataset

After the dataset is collected and transferred, you must tell `hog_transform` which dataset to use and how the ESP32 camera was configured.

### Step 1 – Choose `dataset_name`

Decide the dataset name you are using. This is the folder name created under `result/`. For example:

- If the dataset is in `tools/data_collector/result/gesture/gesture/`, then:
  - `dataset_name` is `gesture`.

Open `tools/hog_transform/hog_config.json` and set the `dataset_name` field:

```jsonc
{
  "dataset_name": "gesture",
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

> Use **only** the dataset folder name (no full path). The `hog_transform` tool knows that datasets live under `tools/data_collector/result/`.

### Step 2 – Copy ESP32 camera settings

Open the camera config file generated by `data_collector`, for example:

- `tools/data_collector/result/gesture/gesture/gesture_camera_config.json`

In `hog_config.json`, there is an `esp32` (or similar) object that stores the ESP32 camera configuration. **Copy this block directly from the camera config file** so that it matches the real capture settings.

Conceptually, you will do something like this:

```jsonc
// In tools/hog_transform/hog_config.json
{
  "dataset_name": "gesture",

  "esp32": {
    // Copy everything inside this object
    // directly from <dataset_name>_camera_config.json

    "frame_width":  96,
    "frame_height": 96,
    "pixel_format": "GRAYSCALE",
    "fps": 30
    // ... any other fields present in the camera config ...
  }

  // ... other HOG configuration parameters ...
}
```

**Important:**

- Do **not** change field names inside the `esp32` block.
- Keep all values exactly the same as in `<dataset_name>_camera_config.json`.
- If the camera config file contains additional parameters (crop, offsets, etc.), copy them all into the `esp32` section of `hog_config.json`.

This ensures that the HOG transform is computed with the **same geometry and format** as the images captured on the ESP32.

            |  5. HOG feature extraction  |
            |  - outputs features for RF  |
            +-----------------------------+
```

With this setup, every dataset captured via `data_collector` can be used consistently with `hog_transform`, ensuring that the model sees exactly the same image geometry as the ESP32 camera during deployment.
